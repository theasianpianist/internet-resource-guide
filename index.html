              Tips for use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Seeking inspiration for your research? The Computer Journal covers a wide swath of computer science, and the latest research from the major areas can usually be found within. Browse through recent issues to see what topics and areas are popular in computer science right now. You could also read through recent papers to look for any questions that current research couldn’t answer, and aim to answer them in your own research.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In over your head? Read the abstracts! Research papers are often dry and difficult to understand, particularly if you lack the requisite background knowledge in the area of study. All research papers published in The Computer Journal (and pretty much every other research journal) contain an abstract, which is a brief summary of the research question and the results obtained. Reading through this summary is much less daunting than parsing the entirety of the paper.

              Tips for use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Search carefully before you post a new question. Sometimes your exact issue has already been asked and answered on the site, you may just have to adjust your search query a little bit to find it. This is also good practice for using Google - if you don’t find what you’re looking for at first, change how you’re searching. Eventually, you’ll learn how to search effectively on the first try.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you do post a new question, give as much detail as possible. StackOverflow suggests that you include a minimal, complete, verifiable example (MCVE). This means including part of the code that you’re trying to write, stripping out any irrelevant portions (minimal), including all information necessary to recreate the problem (complete), and ensuring that the code you provide will faithfully recreate the example (verifiable). Having an MCVE will increase the likelihood of another user being able to solve your issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When interacting with other users, remain polite and cordial. When you’re frustrated with an error, it’s easy to become rude and short when interacting with others, especially over the internet. Keep in mind that other users are complete strangers who have no obligation to help you - any assistance they do provide is on their own time and of their own free will, and they will be less inclined to help someone who is rude.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don’t just read answers to your own questions. Spend some time looking through questions posted by other users - answers on StackOverflow are often incredibly informative and detailed and much can be learned simply by browsing.

                  Come early and come often. In software development, if you’re not constantly brushing up your skills then you’re falling behind. Solving even one problem a day can help you stay up to speed with other developers in industry. Visiting this site often will significantly improve your programming ability over time.

                  Practice specificity. Visiting HackerRank for general programming practice is great. However, HackerRank also comes in handy when practicing for more specific use cases. There’s a technical interview category which contains questions similar to those typically asked during a technical interview at a software company. If you’re looking to learn a new programming language, HackerRank also has language specific categories - it’s often said that the best way to learn a new language is to use it, and this mantra applies to programming languages as well.

                  Challenge yourself. It can be tempting to only answer easy questions to rack up progress points on your profile. However, the whole point of HackerRank is to learn more and get better, not just stagnate and stay in the same place. If you’ve advanced to the point where easy questions are a breeze for you, move on to mediums, and then to hards once you’ve mastered the mediums.

            <h4 id="leet"><a href="https://www.leetcode.com">LeetCode</a></h4>
            <p>
              Much like HackerRank, LeetCode is a website where you can solve programming questions to help you improve your problem solving skills. Unlike HackerRank, LeetCode is focused almost entirely on technical interview preparation, and even has lists of questions most likely to be asked by various software companies (the most popular lists include questions asked by Google, Facebook, and Microsoft interviewers). Because of this feature, LeetCode can give you a much better idea of what types of questions to expect in an interview.

              Tips for use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Similar to HackerRank, it’s best if you spread your practice out over a long period of time rather than trying to cram it all in a day before your interview. Take your time with these questions, and practice often.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No cheating! LeetCode questions usually have thoroughly explained solutions attached. Try to avoid peeking at these until you’ve really given the problem your best attempt. Looking at the solutions means you won’t really spend much time or effort thinking about how to solve the problem on your own, thus weakening your problem solving skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Explore the system design category. System design questions are fairly common in technical interviews and are considered among the hardest type of question to answer. Luckily, LeetCode has an entire category of questions devoted to them (while other sites like HackerRank don’t). Be sure to take advantage of this and get as much practice in as you can before your interview.

            <p>
              The Instagram Engineering blog contains posts written about the various issues that software developers at Instagram encounter. Posts cover the various development domains used at Instagram including mobile and web development, data analytics, and infrastructure management. The anecdotes conveyed in these stories can provide valuable lessons to readers on how to approach problems that arise during software development.

              Tips for use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You are not Instagram. Keep that in mind. Instagram is used by 800 million users per month, and whatever project you’re working on is almost guaranteed to operate at a significantly smaller scale. While the developer blog can be a good source of inspiration for how to go about tackling a problem, it can be unwise to simply copy Instagram’s exact solution. Implementing Instagram’s solution may make sense when you’re operating at the same scale, but another solution might make more sense in a different situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You have a lot to learn from Instagram. Keeping the previous tip in mind, sometimes it is appropriate to solve a problem in the same way that Instagram does. It’s important that you develop the ability to distinguish solutions that are only applicable to Instagram’s specific problem and solutions which can be applied to other situations. For example, the most recent post on the blog talks about optimizing Python’s garbage collection algorithm (for you non-programmers, they’re trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of a process that has already been optimized). Hopefully it’s obvious that this solution won’t be applicable to most situations - until you start to approach Instagram’s scale, the default garbage collection algorithm is more than sufficient for most people’s needs.

              This is the personal blog of Jeff Atwood, one of the most prominent programmers in the modern software development industry; it contains blog posts that focus mostly on software development but occasionally branch out into other tech-related areas. Atwood co-founded StackOverflow (see above) and Discourse, a growing online discussion platform, and is a competent developer in general. As such, his thoughts and opinions are worth a read at the very least. The site is organized chronologically, like most other blogs. Simply scroll down to read older posts, or click on a post title to read and post comments. Anyone looking to work in software development can benefit by reading about Atwood’s experiences and learning about the various aspects of the software development industry.

              Tips for use:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Read with an open mindset. Atwood has more than three decades of experience in the software development industry. Over the years, he’s acquired knowledge of best practices in the industry, useful tips and tricks for improving your workflow, and much more. One of the most important concepts that Atwood talks about in his posts is developing a proper developer mindset (though he never explicitly refers to it as such). This includes how to approach problems, how to ensure that best practices are actually implemented, etc. Atwood has vast stores of advice that trickle out into his blog posts, and everyone could benefit from learning something new.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take everything with a grain of salt. While Atwood is extremely qualified to write about programming and software development, keep in mind that he is just one person with one opinion. Don’t treat his word as gospel - if something that he says doesn’t quite make sense or if a suggestion he makes wouldn’t work well in your particular situation, do your own research and come to your own conclusion. Atwood writes good code and blog posts but that doesn’t make him omniscient.
